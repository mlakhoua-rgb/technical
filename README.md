## 👋 Welcome

This repository documents my **hands-on technical capabilities** and **leadership experience** across datacenter/cloud infrastructure, DevOps, and Systems Engineering. 

While I operate at VP/Director/Head level focusing on strategy, P&L, and team leadership, I maintain deep technical expertise in **infrastructure, security, systems administration, and networking**—enabling me to architect solutions, validate technical decisions, and step in during critical moments.

**For startups:** I can be hands-on from Day 1, building teams, processes, and infrastructure from ground zero, then naturally transitioning to strategic leadership as the organization scales.

**Key Stats:**
- 🎯 **25+ years** in Datacenter/cloud operations, IT infrastructure setup and service delivery. 
- 💰 **€13M+ budgets** managed with 25-40% EBIT margins
- 🏆 **100% client retention** over 14 years
- 📈 **99.9-99.99% uptime** across government, financial, and enterprise platforms
- 👥 **0→50 team scaling** with 95%+ employee retention

## 🔧 Technical Philosophy

I believe in **"hands-off leadership with hands-on capability"**:

> "Great technical leaders set direction, empower experts, and remove obstacles—but they must deeply understand the technology to make informed decisions. 
I maintain hands-on proficiency through AI-assisted development (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, RovoAI), continuous learning, and real-world practice—enabling me to validate architecture, mentor effectively, and step in during critical moments.
**My leadership philosophy:** Build strong teams who execute faster than I can—but maintain technical depth to earn their respect, make informed decisions, and guide strategic direction."

### **My Approach:**
- ✅ **Strategic by default** - Focus on P&L, client relationships, and organizational design
- ✅ **Technical when needed** - Can review architecture, debug critical issues, validate solutions
- ✅ **AI-augmented** - Use modern tools to stay efficient without becoming a bottleneck
- ✅ **Team-first** - Build strong manager layers and delegate 80% of tactical execution
