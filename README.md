## 🔧 Technical Philosophy

I believe in **"hands-off leadership with hands-on capability"**:

> "Great technical leaders set direction, empower experts, and remove obstacles—but they must deeply understand the technology to make informed strategic decisions. I maintain hands-on skills through AI-assisted development, enabling me to validate architectural decisions, mentor teams effectively, and step in during critical moments."

### **My Approach:**
- ✅ **Strategic by default** - Focus on P&L, client relationships, and organizational design
- ✅ **Technical when needed** - Can review architecture, debug critical issues, validate solutions
- ✅ **AI-augmented** - Use modern tools to stay efficient without becoming a bottleneck
- ✅ **Team-first** - Build strong manager layers and delegate 80% of tactical execution
