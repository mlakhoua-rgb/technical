## 👋 Welcome

This repository documents my **technical leadership capabilities** and **strategic expertise** across datacenter/cloud infrastructure, DevOps, and systems engineering.

As a **VP/Director-level technology leader**, I focus on **strategic direction, organizational design, and informed decision-making** rather than hands-on execution. My foundation as a **Network and Systems Engineer** provides the deep technical understanding necessary to architect solutions, validate technical proposals, and guide engineering teams with credibility.

**Key Distinction:** I lead through strategic oversight and technical comprehension, not personal code execution. I use AI tools to **verify, understand, and test**—enabling me to stay technically current and make informed decisions without becoming a bottleneck.

**Key Stats:**
- 🎯 **25+ years** in Datacenter/cloud operations, IT infrastructure setup and service delivery. 
- 💰 **€13M+ budgets** managed with 25-40% EBIT margins
- 🏆 **100% client retention** over 14 years
- 📈 **99.9-99.99% uptime** across government, financial, and enterprise platforms
- 👥 **0→50 team scaling** with 95%+ employee retention

## 🔧 Technical Philosophy

I believe in **"informed leadership with deep technical understanding"**:

> "Great technology leaders set strategic direction, empower expert teams, and remove obstacles—and they must deeply understand the technology to make informed decisions. I maintain technical credibility through continuous learning, staying current with industry trends, and using AI tools to verify and understand emerging technologies. My leadership approach: Build strong teams who execute faster than I can—while maintaining technical depth to earn their respect, validate their proposals, and guide strategic direction."

### **My Approach:**
- ✅ **Strategic by default** - Focus on P&L, client relationships, organizational design, and technology roadmap
- ✅ **Technical when needed** - Can review architecture, validate proposals, challenge technical assumptions, and mentor effectively
- ✅ **AI-informed** - Use modern tools to stay technically current and understand emerging technologies without becoming a bottleneck
- ✅ **Team-first** - Build strong manager layers, delegate execution, and focus on strategic oversight
- ✅ **Credible leadership** - Technical foundation as engineer ensures respect and informed decision-making
